Ondemandenv Platform: SOA Distributed System SDLC Management
1. Overview
   A platform designed to manage the lifecycle of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) distributed systems, focusing on microservice dependencies, team collaboration, and environment-as-code workflows. Key objectives include:

Dependency Management: Define and enforce contracts between services/environments.

Environment Isolation: Enable on-demand, mutable/immutable environments ("envers") with secure isolation.

Automated Deployment: Deploy resources across AWS accounts using deterministic CDK/CloudFormation.

Consistency: Ensure logic/functionality consistency across cloned environments while avoiding resource conflicts.

2. Core Components
   2.1 Enver (Environment Version)
   Definition: A logical unit representing a versioned environment, including infrastructure, containers, and configurations.

Types:

Mutable Enver: Associated with a branch in source repos; supports incremental deployments as code changes.

Immutable Enver: Associated with a tag; dependencies must also be immutable.

Outputs:

Docker image URI/SHA.

CDK deployment artifacts.

Custom resources via scripts (e.g., SSM parameters, S3 URIs).

2.2 ContractsLib
Purpose: Acts as a "congress" to define dependencies between envers, ensuring architectural integrity.

Features:

TypeScript-based with strict typing and unit tests.

Negotiated via PRs (like "bills") to enforce inter-team agreements.

Prevents invalid dependencies (e.g., immutable envers cannot depend on mutable ones).

Semantic versioning for backward compatibility.

2.3 Config Store
Implementation: Uses AWS SSM Parameter Store (configuration values), Secrets Manager (secrets), and EventBridge (change events).

Versioning: All values are versioned; events trigger downstream workflows (e.g., Lambda functions for updates).

Security: Envers’ configurations are isolated; teams cannot access each other’s data.

2.4 Platform Infrastructure
Accounts:

Central Account: Hosts platform deployment, CI/CD pipelines, and ContractsLib.

Workspace Accounts: Host workloads (e.g., EKS clusters, VPCs).

Specialized Accounts: Networking, logging, security (isolated by purpose).

IAM/STS: Central account assumes roles across other accounts for deployments.

3. Enver Lifecycle
   3.1 Creation
   Cloning:

Create a new branch with odmd: create@<target branch>; clones inherit dependencies but use unique resource names (e.g., my-env-clone).

Isolation: Clones are fully isolated but share dependency logic (e.g., same CDK code with branch-specific parameters).

Limits: Up to 20 clones per enver; manual deletion required.

3.2 Deployment
Process:

CDK synthesizes templates using branch/tag as a parameter.

Resources deploy to target AWS accounts/regions (defined in enver configuration).

Products (e.g., IPAM CIDR, EKS endpoints) are written to the config store.

Rollback: CloudFormation automatically reverts failed deployments.

3.3 Dependency Resolution
Cyclic Dependencies:

Resolved via placeholders (e.g., networking enver initializes without central logging, then updates post-logging setup).

Consumer Configuration:

Define placeholder values for initial setup.

React to upstream changes via EventBridge-triggered workflows (e.g., alarms, redeployments).

4. Built-In Builds
   Build	Description	Account
   ContractsLib	Compiles/deploys ContractsLib; enforces dependency contracts.	Workspace0
   Networking	Deploys VPCs, TGWs, and IPAM ranges. Each enver has a unique TGW.	Networking
   User Auth	Manages web console (AppSync) for visualizing contracts.	Workspace0
   EKS Cluster	Hosts EKS clusters; integrates with networking envers for VPC connectivity.	Workspace0
5. CI/CD Workflow
   Implementation: GitHub Actions, AWS CodePipeline, or Step Functions.

Central Account Tasks:

Generates standardized GitHub workflows for envers.

Monitors config store changes and triggers downstream pipelines.

Testing:

Unit Tests: Run in enver-specific CI/CD.

Integration/E2E Tests: Deployed as separate envers or integrated into target enver workflows.

6. Security & Isolation
   IAM Roles: Envers deploy using AWS STS with least-privilege roles.

OIDC Federation: EKS service accounts map to workspace IAM roles via OIDC.

Branch/Tag Isolation: Configurations are securely isolated between teams/branches.

7. ContractsLib Structure
   Level 1: Base interfaces/types (Build, Enver, Producer, Consumer) and central account contracts.

Level 2: Business-specific implementations (e.g., GitHub App setup, enver target accounts).

Ownership: Level 1 maintained by platform team; Level 2 by service owners.

8. Adding a New Service
   Define the service as a Build and Enver in ContractsLib Level 2.

Publish ContractsLib updates (PRs require team consensus).

Consume/publish enver products via config store.

9. Web GUI
   Features:

Interactive architecture diagram of enver dependencies (AppSync + GraphQL).

Real-time syncing from config store.

Deployment visibility (e.g., clone status, pipeline progress).

10. Best Practices
    Avoid Dependency Cycles: Use placeholders for initialization.

Immutable for Prod: Tag-based envers ensure stability.

Resource Naming: Use CFN-generated physical names or branch/tag suffixes for uniqueness.

11. Example Use Case: Networking + EKS
    Networking Enver:

Provisions VPC, TGW, and IPAM CIDR.

Writes CIDR to SSM (/networking/enver-1/cidr).

EKS Enver:

Reads CIDR from SSM.

Deploys EKS cluster in the CIDR range.

Exposes cluster endpoint via SSM (/eks/enver-2/endpoint).

12. Future Considerations
    Cross-Region Support: Extend enver deployments to multiple regions.

Custom Resource Providers: Allow teams to define non-AWS resources (e.g., SaaS integrations).
