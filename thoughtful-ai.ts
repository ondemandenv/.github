/**
 * Sort the packages using the following criteria:
 *
 * - A package is **bulky** if its volume (Width x Height x Length) is greater than or equal to 1,000,000 cmÂ³ or when one of its dimensions is greater or equal to 150 cm.
 * - A package is **heavy** when its mass is greater or equal to 20 kg.
 *
 * You must dispatch the packages in the following stacks:
 *
 * - **STANDARD**: standard packages (those that are not bulky or heavy) can be handled normally.
 * - **SPECIAL**: packages that are either heavy or bulky can't be handled automatically.
 * - **REJECTED**: packages that are **both** heavy and bulky are rejected.
 *
 * ### Implementation
 *
 * Implement the function **`sort(width, height, length, mass)`** (units are centimeters for the dimensions and kilogram for the mass). This function must return a string: the name of the stack where the package should go.
 * @param width
 * @param height
 * @param length
 * @param mass
